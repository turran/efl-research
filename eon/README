Comments on the implementation
+ Do we actaully need to export as an API function the foo_type_get() ?
  where it can be used? the only place it makes sense (beside of foo.c file itself)
  is for the cast, like what Etk had. But the cast can be done internal (slower)
  but we avoid the need to export those function which might be problematic
  Another place to use it is on type_instance_new(foo_type_get()), but in case of
  a xml parser:
  <widget>
  </widget>
  we should do:
  if (!strcmp(tag, "widget"))
    widget_new(); // or type_instance_new(widget_type_get());
  what if we just do this:
  type_instance_new_name_from(tag);
  so this works like type_instance_property_set(type, instance, attribute, value); 
 
+ The foo_bar_get(Foo *f) functions should be fast, as it access the private
  struct and the type/object interface is not used at all
+ The foo_bar_set(Foo *f, void *bar) functions are slower as it access the
  type interface

+ Filters!!!
  basically a filter is just a definition, you can't render a definition but objects.
  this objects can reference a filter pipe to use in order to generate the destination
  pixels.

+ Handle the case whenever an object references another and the referenced object changes
  a duual state attribute, if that's the case the referencing object should change too.
