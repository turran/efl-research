Welcome to EFL-Sharp!

EFL-Sharp (or EFL#) beings the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (and more)
to the C# programming language.

EFL# binds almost all the EFL C API and tightly ties it into an object
oriented representation making C# programmers feel at home with it.

This distribution also includes Eblocks, a widget library (toolkit) that
follows the GTK# API and makes uses of EFL# for all of its drawing.
