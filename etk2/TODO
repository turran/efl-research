+ Do we actaully need to export as an API function the foo_type_get() ?
  where it can be used? the only place it makes sense (beside of foo.c file itself)
  is for the cast, like what Etk had. But the cast can be done internal (slower)
  but we avoid the need to export those function which might be problematic
  Another place to use it is on type_instance_new(foo_type_get()), but in case of
  a xml parser:
  <widget>
  </widget>
  we should do:
  if (!strcmp(tag, "widget"))
    widget_new(); // or type_instance_new(widget_type_get());
  what if we just do this:
  type_instance_new_name_from(tag);
  so this works like type_instance_property_set(type, instance, attribute, value);
