+ Do we actaully need to export as an API function the foo_type_get() ?
  where it can be used? the only place it makes sense (beside of foo.c file itself)
  is for the cast, like what Etk had. But the cast can be done internal (slower)
  but we avoid the need to export those function which might be problematic
