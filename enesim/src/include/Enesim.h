 * @defgroup Enesim_Group API
 * @{
 * 
 * In Enesim every intermediate surface format is argb8888_pre, so all surface
 * modes should know how to convert to/from argb8888_pre
 * 
 * To add a new surface format you should follow the next steps:
 * 1. Add a new entry to Enesim_Surface_Format enumaration in enesim_surface.h
 *    the format is TODO
 * 2. Create a new ENESIM_SURFACE_FORMAT(name, [yes | no]) entry into
 *    configure.in 
 * 3. Create a data struct for that format in enesim_surface.h, every plane 
 *    should be named as planeX, in case the pixel length is smaller than the 
 *    data type and contiguous you should also create a planeX_pixel variable. 
 * 4. Add your new data type to the Enesim_Surface_Data union, it should be of
 *    the same name as the format type
 * 5. Go to enesim_generator.c and follow the instructions on the beginning of
 *    the file
 * 6. Add a rule to generate the core headers in src/include/Makefile.am
 * 7. Add a rule to generate the drawer source files in src/lib/drawer/Makefile.am
 * 8. Add the drawer to the array of drawers in enesim_drawer.c, with the
 *    conditional building of course
 * 9. Add your includes in enesim_private.h in a similar way
 *
