Etch is an abstract canvas and object layout library that supports
aribitrary object types, aimations, timelines, and events.

Etch's primary goals are:

1) Abstract layout engine that has canvases and sub-canvases, objects,
moving around, resizing, animating, timeline support, and events.

2) Support multiple display / rendering technologies that can tie into the
Etch abstraction layer.

3) Eventually have a designer application build on top of Etch that allows
the user to create and live preview Etch gui's.
