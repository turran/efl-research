Etch is an abstract canvas and object layout library that supports
aribitrary object types, aimations, timelines, and events.

Etch's primary goals are:

1) Abstract layout engine that has canvases and sub-canvases, objects,
moving around, resizing, animating, timeline support, and events.

2) Support multiple display / rendering technologies that can tie into the
Etch abstraction layer.

3) Eventually have a designer application build on top of Etch that allows
the user to create and live preview Etch gui's.

4) Support random objects using interfaces and object querying to determine
what an object can and cant do. This can be done via xml / wbxml
specifications for objects.

5) Object creation is done using object classes.
Etch_Object *etch_object_new(Etch_Object_Class *class);

An Etch_Object_Class defines the required functions for objects to implement
and has a pointer that can point to arbitrary data that the object can use
to set data and properties (this can be done using a populater function)
TODO: decide on what an object class should contain.

6) Canvas creation is done using a similar idea to object creation.
TODO: decide on what a canvas class should be.
